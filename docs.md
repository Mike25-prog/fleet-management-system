# AI-Powered Balancing of Matatu Routes

## Machine Learning for Demand Prediction

- Develop and train a sophisticated machine learning model using:
  - Historical booking data
  - Traffic patterns (including rush hour trends)
  - Weather information (rainfall, temperature)
  - Special events calendar (holidays, festivals, major sports events)
- Use regression or time series forecasting techniques to predict future demand accurately
- Implement feature engineering to extract meaningful patterns from raw data
- Regularly retrain the model (e.g., monthly) to adapt to changing trends

## Dynamic Route Allocation

- Create a real-time optimization algorithm that considers:
  - Predicted demand from the machine learning model
  - Current vehicle locations and capacities
  - Driver schedules and shift patterns
- Implement a scoring system for routes based on profitability, passenger need, and strategic importance
- Use techniques like linear programming or genetic algorithms for efficient allocation
- Provide a user-friendly interface for sacco managers to view and manually adjust allocations if needed

## Real-time Adjustments

- Integrate multiple real-time data sources:
  - Tracking of matatu locations
  - Traffic congestion updates from mapping services
  - Passenger booking/cancellation data
  - Reroute vehicles to address unexpected spikes in passenger volume
  - Suggest alternate routes to drivers in case of severe traffic or road closures

## Benefits of AI-powered Balancing
